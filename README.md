## Background
The project plan to use an [open database](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) which contains 918 observations with 12 attributes to establish heart failure prediction models. Machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, random forests are possible choices for model fitting. Also, our program will allow heart failure prediction for new variants of patients.

## How our model look like ?



***The following demonstration***



## How can this script help you predict the heart failure?
