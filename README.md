## Background
The project plan to use an [open database](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) which contains 918 observations with 12 attributes to establish heart failure prediction models. 
Machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests are possible choices for model fitting. Also, our program will allow heart failure prediction for new variants of a patient.

## Setup instructions
1) git clone the repo
2) do ```python pip install ``` to install the repo below
   Data Address:  ```pandas```  ```numpy```  ```joblib``` ```sklearn```
   Draw Figures:  ```Pillow``` ```matplotlib``` ```seaborn```
   GUI Interface: ```tkinter``` ``` easygui``` 

## How our data look like ?
