## Background
The project plan to use an [open database](https://store.steampowered.com/app/341290/Lazors/) which contains 918 observations with 12 attributes to establish heart failure prediction models. Machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, random forests are possible choices for model fitting. Also, our program will allow heart failure prediction for new variants of patients.
<!-- Lazor is a popular puzzle game in which you need to arrange blocks wisely to achieve the goals at each level. You can get this game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/341290/Lazors/), [Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.pyrosphere.lazors&hl=en_US&gl=US), or search it on App Store. Some of the levels are easy, but some of them can be hard to solve. This project is to solve some of them. -->

## How our model look like ?
